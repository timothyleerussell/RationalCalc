Notes
-----

RationalCalcBase is a library project that provides the logic for both RationalCalc and RationalCalcFree. The main difference between the two shells is the inclusion of Admob ads in RationalCalcFree and some minor layout changes to support that scenario.

The admob publisher id has been redacted from RationalCalcFree\AndroidManifest.xml
